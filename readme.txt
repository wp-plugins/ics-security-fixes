The plugin tries to fix known WordPress vulnerabilities for older WordPress versions.
Warning: For PHP 5 only.

== Description ==

Like any other software WordPress does have bugs and security vulnerabilities. They get fixed when the developers become aware of them.
However, sometimes several WordPress releases are vulnerable. The problem is that the developers do not backport security updates to older WordPress releases.
As a result, those who do not want to upgrade their WordPress installations (for example, because newer WP releases tend to consume more system resources and
upgrade may result in having to use more expensive hosting) remain vulnerable.

ICS Security Fixes is the plugin for those who do not upgrade their WordPress: the plugin tries to fix known WordPress vulnerabilities
at that remaining compatible with as many old WordPress releases as possible.
And though it cannot fix all known vulnerabilities, it makes older WordPress installations more secure.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ics-security-fixes` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Have fun :-)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

None yet. Be the first to ask.

== Warning ==

This plugins requires that PHP 5 be installed. PHP 4 is not supported.

== Screenshots ==

No screenshots, as the plugin does not require user intervention :-) It just works.

== Upgrade Notice ==

It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of the plugin. New versions bring new bug fixes and hopefully do not put in any new bugs.
